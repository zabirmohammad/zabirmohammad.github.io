As an instructor and mentor for the AMIR Lab’s **AI Research Bootcamp**, I guide undergraduate students through the fundamentals of **machine learning, deep learning, and research methodology**. My role includes delivering hands-on sessions, supervising mini-projects, and helping students develop the skills needed to initiate their own independent research.

I provide structured guidance on:
- Designing deep learning experiments  
- Implementing models in Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
- Understanding research papers and identifying research gaps  
- Writing and presenting research findings effectively  

Through this program, I help students build a strong foundation in **AI and computer vision**, preparing them for future academic and industrial research roles.
